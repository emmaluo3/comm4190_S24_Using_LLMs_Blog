We weren't allowed to return to campus to get our stuff for 6-7 months. I was so ready to have an awesome end of college with all of my friends, and now I haven't seen some of them since that day we left. We graduated over a zoom call. All of them moved around the country, tried to find work, life happened. There was no real transition or celebration, it was just \"OK you're an adult in the real world now I guess, congrats\" It still really upsets me tbh, but I know a lot of people had it way worse. Just sucks. They were some fun dudes to be around. Finally flew down to see one of them but ugh, I'd kill to be able to have that 4 months of my last year of college.*\n",
