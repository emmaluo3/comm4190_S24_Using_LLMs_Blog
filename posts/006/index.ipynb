    "\tThe image shows a crest or emblem featuring a shield at its center, set against a blue and red background. On the shield, there are three white round shapes arranged in a triangular formation (two at the top and one at the bottom) on a blue field. Above the shield, there is a wavy white line that resembles a snake, flanked by two books with white pages, all set within a red band. This emblem is typical for academic institutions, suggesting it might be the crest of a university or college. The text is partially obscured, but it ends with the word \"UNIVERSITY,\" further supporting that this is related to an educational institution. The exact name and location of the university cannot be determined from the cropped and partially visible text.\n",

    "- A shield at the center with a white or silver background that features a blue chevron (an inverted 'V' shape) and three round dots, which could be heraldic symbols or represent something specific to the institution.\n",
    "- Above the shield, there is a banner with a red background that contains a depiction of an open book on either side, suggesting a focus on education and knowledge.\n",
    "- Between the books, there is an image of a serpent or snake, which can be a symbol of wisdom, medicine, or could represent something specific about the university's tradition, depending on the context."
