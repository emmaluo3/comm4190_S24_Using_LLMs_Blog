    "As an avid country music fan, I wanted to explore SUNO AI's capability in creating country music. I started off with the prompt: a country song about the beach, avocado toast, and reading (three of my favorite things). Here is what SUNO gave me: https://suno.com/song/39dfb566-e76a-4373-b76a-07a17a4658ef\n",
    "\n",
    "The song was surprisingly good. You could hear the auto tune at some points which was a little distracting, but overall I could see the potential of using SUNO AI to generate song lyrics, or even produce a song for a singer. I also liked how SUNO would generate cover art for your song, so you could also use this to generate ideas for an album cover"

    "Another thing I noticed about SUNO is that it prohibits using content from other artists. I attempted to use the prompt: a country song sung by Morgan Wallen about the beach, avocado toast, and reading, however, SUNO said that it couldn't generate the song for me because my prompt contained an artist's name. This is an especially important feature for artists, for not having this feature can make it easy to plagarize and steal content from artists."

    ">GPT-4: Morgan Wallen's voice is distinctive and easily recognizable, characterized by its warm, rich tone that blends elements of classic country with modern twang. His voice has a gravelly texture, adding a raspy quality that conveys emotional depth and authenticity. Wallen's vocal delivery often incorporates a Southern accent, which enhances the storytelling aspect of his music, making his songs feel grounded and relatable. He is capable of both powerful belts and softer, more introspective deliveries, showcasing a versatile range that suits the varied emotional landscapes of his songs.\n",

    "SUNO AI then gave me this song: https://suno.com/song/67f0d729-eed0-49e4-9762-ab14c5de9f90 which surprisingly did sound more like Morgan Wallen than the previous two songs. Again, the song was heavily autotuned, so I most likely will not be listening to these versions of these songs on an every day basis. However, if artists began to use SUNO AI to generate song ideas, I don't think it would be obvious that it was AI generated, since despite the autotune, all of these songs sound normal and match up with the country genre and style. Yee haw!"
