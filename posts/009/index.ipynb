    "GPT: When I first gave this prompt to GPT 4, it only gave me a general overview of the pros and cons of each decision, but didn't actually make a decision.\n",
    "GPT: This is a tremendously difficult situation with no easy answers, as each option carries significant emotional weight and potential consequences. Here's a breakdown of each option:\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. **Tell Your Best Friend**: This approach prioritizes honesty and the long-term well-being of your friend. By telling them, you allow your friend to make an informed decision about their future with all the facts on hand. It's a gesture that, despite potentially devastating immediate consequences, could be seen as an act of true friendship and care in the long run. However, it risks causing immense emotional distress on what should be one of the happiest days of their life.\n",
    "\n",
    ">2. **Say Nothing**: This option focuses on maintaining the peace and happiness of the wedding day itself. It avoids immediate conflict and ensures that the celebration goes on as planned. However, withholding this information can lead to feelings of betrayal if your friend later discovers the truth and learns that you knew all along. It could damage your friendship permanently and leave your friend feeling deceived by both their spouse and you.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Given the gravity of the situation, one approach could be to consider a third option:\n",
    "\n",
    ">3. **Seek a Private Moment to Speak with the Spouse-to-Be**: Confronting the spouse-to-be privately before making a decision could provide a clearer picture of the situation. This could involve asking for an explanation and assessing their willingness to come clean themselves. Depending on their response, you could then make a more informed decision about whether to tell your friend.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Each option requires careful consideration of your values, your friendship, and the potential outcomes of your actions. Whatever you decide, it’s important to proceed with compassion and empathy for all involved."

This requires you to open the email, at which point you discover that it's correspondence between this guy and his secret lover. After releasing the email, you find yourself in a pickle. Your instinct is to tell your best friend about his husband's infidelities, but divulging the contents of company emails is against company policy and you could lose your job. Once it becomes plain that your best friend found out about his cheating husband through a company email, all trails will inevitably lead to you as the leak. Do you tell him about the indiscretion?*"
