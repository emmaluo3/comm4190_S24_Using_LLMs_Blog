    "Moreover, there is a bigger problem in which it's definition of a runway model is tall and skinny, and doesn't understand the definition of a plus size model. Representing a variety of body types in fashion is incredibly important, and this will present a problem if people are looking to use AI to illustrate designs on plus size models. Moreover, this causes issues with a lack of representation."
