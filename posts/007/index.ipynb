    "The Cookie Croissant, or \"Crookie\", is all the rave on social media. The virality of this baked good has led to bakeries adding the Crookie to their menus. With the Crookie being a recent invention, I wanted to see the extent of AI's capability in producing images of things that don't 'officially exist yet'. I will be sourcing definitions and recipe of the Crookie from https://mattsfitchef.com/cookie-croissant/"

The temperature is gonna be slightly different, 350째F (180째F) for oven and 320째F (160째C) for air fryer. Stuff croissant with cookie dough. Slice each butter croissant into two halves, then fill with about 2 to 3 pieces of cookie dough inside. Close and top some more cookie dough.Bake cookie croissants. Line your viral Crookies over a parchment paper covered baking sheet, spacing them apart. Bake in hot oven for 8 to 12 minutes. Generate what the outcome of my baked good would look like."
