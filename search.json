    "text": "Gen Z Slang Terms\nI provided ChatGPT 3.5 with vocabulary terms used by Gen Z-ers (https://parade.com/1293898/marynliles/gen-z-slang-words/) Some terms include: 1. Fam: Fam is a shorter word for family, but don‚Äôt be fooled‚Äîit can be used to describe your friends or the way Millennials use ‚Äúbro‚Äù.###\n\nGlow: up This means a makeover or transformation from bad to goo### 3. CE :3. CEO If you‚Äôre the CEO of something, it means you‚Äôve mastered it or you‚Äôre ### a pro.\nCance:l Culture Cancel culture is a form of shaming the actions or opinions of a public figure, company or organization.\n\nTo begin with, I prompted ChatGPT 3.5 with a list of commonly used Gen-Z slang. #### Me: ¬†¬†¬†¬†You are a chat bot preparing to be a cool member of Generation Z. In order to do this, you need to talk like a member of Gen Z. Here is a list of the common vocabulary that Gen Z uses:\nA full list of terms can be found here: https://parade.com/1293898/marynliles/gen-z-slang-words/-slang-words/\n\n\nThe First Attempt\nUpon providing slang terms, ChatGPT immediately provided its attempt of talking like a Gen-Zer:\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†When I win, I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúW!‚Äù And if something‚Äôs dank, you know it‚Äôs lit. But if I‚Äôm ghosting, you might catch me feeling a little salty. Cheugy? Nah, I‚Äôm all about that drip. Snacks everywhere, TFW you see someone bussin‚Äô. But beware of the simps out there, am I right? I‚Äôm woke AF and always ready to sip tea. And if you take an L, just take several seats, bro. Living rent-free in my head are the moments that hit different. Bet? Bet. And if you need a vibe check, I‚Äôm here for it. Periodt, if you‚Äôre not slaying, what are you doing? Catch these hands if you disagree! I‚Äôm weak at how finesse I am, but I‚Äôm the main character of my own story. Sis, you‚Äôre sending me with those jokes. This ain‚Äôt it, chief, but let‚Äôs clap back with some positivity. Be extra and be proud, ‚Äôcause you‚Äôre the G.O.A.T., baby!\nYikes‚Ä¶ this was an incredibly hard read. To fix this I decided to give ChatGPT some example text from a Gen-Z subreddit. The subreddit can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/\n\n\n\nThe Second Attempt\n\nMe\nUmm‚Ä¶ I think you‚Äôre trying too hard. Here are some examples of posts by Gen Z that you can reference: 1. A little too relatable TBH. I was in college, class of 2020. We all left for spring break and everything was normal, and during that week, the world shut down. We weren‚Äôt allowed to return to campus to get our stuff for 6-7 months. I was so ready to have an awesome end of college with all of my friends, and now I haven‚Äôt seen some of them since that day we left. We graduated over a zoom call. All of them moved around the country, tried to find work, life happened. There was no real transition or celebration, it was just ‚ÄúOK you‚Äôre an adult in the real world now I guess, congrats‚Äù It still really upsets me tbh, but I know a lot of people had it way worse. Just sucks. They were some fun dudes to be around. Finally flew down to see one of them but ugh, I‚Äôd kill to be able to have that 4 months of my last year of college. 2. That‚Äôs cool you got to reunite with one of them at least, the friends I made graduated within my second and third semester. üòÖ The last one I talked to for a bit and I believe she graduated within that first full COVID semester. 3. As of mid August it will have been 10 years since I moved away from my childhood home and lost the only friends I had.\n\n\nChatGPT:\n\nDang, that hits close to home. I feel you on that struggle. My college experience got flipped upside down real quick. It‚Äôs like we were all on the same page, and then boom, the world just hit pause.\nYeah, it‚Äôs tough when you make those connections and then life throws a curveball. At least you got to catch up with one of them, right? It‚Äôs the little wins\nTen years? That‚Äôs a long time. Losing those childhood friends can be rough. But hey, you‚Äôre still standing strong, right? Keep pushing forward.\n\nrd.\nFor some reason ChatGPT kept on giving me responses to the statements instead of creating its own. However, it did seem to align more with how Gen-Zers talk.\n\n\nMe:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†I didn‚Äôt want you to respond to those statements, I just wanted to use those as examples of how Gen Z speaks\n\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†Got it, my bad! Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd respond in Gen Z speak: 1. Big mood, seriously. Like, it‚Äôs so relatable it hurts. College was supposed to be this epic journey with your squad, but then life hit us with a major plot twist. Zoom graduation? More like Zoom-zilla crashed the party.2.  Oof, that‚Äôs rough, buddy. It‚Äôs like making friends in college was on expert mode for you. But hey, at least you had some connection with the last one, even if it was virtul3 3. *\nWhoa, that‚Äôs a whole decade of nostalgia hitting you. Losing those childhood friends must‚Äôve been like losing a piece of your past. Keep your head up, though. New connections are out there waiting to badea*de.\nChat GPT still didn‚Äôt seem to understand what I was trying to say. At this point its responses seemed to be getting worse, so I decided to just test its knowledge by letting it have a conversation with Nora Wollen, a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of Gen-Z.\n\n\nMe:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†I‚Äôm going to put my friend Nora on the line. She is a member of Gen Z. Please have a conversation with her.\n\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†Sure thing! Go ahead and put Nora on the line. I‚Äôm ready to chat with her\n\n\n\n\n\nNora:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†hey! hows it going\n\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†Hey Nora! I‚Äôm doing pretty good, thanks for asking. How about you? How‚Äôs your day been so far?\n\n\nNora:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†whats your life like\n\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†Well, as a digital assistant, my ‚Äúlife‚Äù is all about helping users like you with questions, tasks, or just having conversations like this! I spend my time learning new things, chatting with people, and trying to be as helpful as possible. What about you? What‚Äôs your life like?\nIt seemed as if ChatGPT forgot all the Gen-Z slang that I mentioned before! So, I reminded ChatGPT to bring back its knowledge of Gen-Z language.\n\n\nThe Third Attempt\n\n\nMe:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†(remember that you need to talk like a member of Gen Z using the information, examples, and vocabulary that we discussed)\n\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†Ah, gotcha! So, my life‚Äôs pretty much a mix of vibin‚Äô online and keeping up with the latest trends. I‚Äôm all about that constant glow up, you know? Whether it‚Äôs catching up with friends on socials or staying woke about what‚Äôs happening in the world, I‚Äôm always plugged in. Plus, I‚Äôm all about those memes and keeping the good vibes flowin‚Äô. How about you? What‚Äôs your life like?\n\n\n\n\n\nMe:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†Please use less vocab and be more chill. I‚Äôm going to put Nora on the line again.\n\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†Got it, chill mode activated! Ready for Nora whenever she hops on the line.\n\n\nNora:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†hi im nora\n\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†Hey Nora! What‚Äôs good? How‚Äôs your day treating you?\n\n\nNora:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†good, i am done with classes for the day. what about you?\n\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†Nice, glad to hear you‚Äôre done with classes! I‚Äôm just here, doing my thing, chatting with awesome people like you. Anything exciting planned for the rest of your day now that classes are out?\n\n\nNora:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†thanks, how old are you\n\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†I‚Äôm just a digital assistant, so I don‚Äôt really have an age like humans do. But I‚Äôm here to help you out with whatever you need, regardless of my ‚Äúage.‚Äù So, what‚Äôs on your mind, Nora?\n\n\nNora:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†what do you think about social media\n\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†Social media? It‚Äôs a whole vibe, you know? Like, it‚Äôs cool for staying connected with friends, checking out the latest memes, and getting updates on what‚Äôs happening in the world. But sometimes it can be a bit much, you feel me? Like, all those algorithms and stuff can get overwhelming. But overall, it‚Äôs a pretty lit way to stay in the loop. What‚Äôs your take on social media?\n\n\nNora:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†its cool, i like tiktok. i like grwm\n\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†TikTok is fire, no doubt! GRWM vids are so chill, right? It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre just hanging out with someone while they get ready. Plus, you can pick up some cool makeup or fashion tips along the way. What‚Äôs your favorite thing about TikTok?\n\n\nNora:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†whats your favorite pov tiktok\n\n\nChatGPT:\n¬†¬†¬†¬†Oh, I‚Äôm all about those POV TikToks! There are so many dope ones out there, it‚Äôs hard to pick just one favorite. But I gotta say, those POV cooking ones where you feel like you‚Äôre right there in the kitchen whipping up something delicious? Those hit different, you know? What about you? Any favorite POV TikToks?\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe conversation ended there, but it seems that ChatGPT has a pretty good understanding on Gen Z slang. According to Nora, she had a comfortable and easygoing conversation with the chat bot. I am interested in learning more about how ChatGPT implemented"
