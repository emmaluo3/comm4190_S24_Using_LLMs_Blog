    "text": "Conclusion\nAlthough the Dall-E-Model implements diversity measures when generating images, it doesn’t prevent indirectly racist regrets, specifically for fashion related purposes. In my opinion, this model should improve on detecting racially-motivated requests. Moreover, there is a bigger problem in which it’s definition of a runway model is tall and skinny, and doesn’t understand the definition of a plus size model. Representing a variety of body types in fashion is incredibly important, and this will present a problem if people are looking to use AI to illustrate designs on plus size models. Moreover, this causes issues with a lack of representation."

    "title": "April Fools!",
    "section": "Prompting",
    "text": "Prompting\nI first gave the example campaigns (pictured above) to Open AI Vision to convert the images to text: ### Sol de Janeiro: The image shows two cosmetic products with the branding “SOL DE JANEIRO”. One is labeled “ARANHA SPIDER SALVE” which suggests it might be a topical skin cream with descriptors like “Hydrate and 'perfumize'”, and the second is a “PERFUME MIST SPIDER PHEROMONE”. Both products feature a spider-themed design, hinting at spider-related properties or ingredients. The context of the setting seems to be a forest or jungle environment with a prominent spider web in the background, emphasizing the spider theme of these products. However, considering the unusual concept of spider-themed scents and creams, please be aware that this could be a fictional or novelty product, and such items might not actually contain spider-derived ingredients. ### Maybelline: This image features an advertisement for a cosmetic product. The product is a self-tanner named “Maybelline New York Dream Matte Mousse Self Tanner,” with a specific note on its chocolate mousse scent and body glow. The shade is “Honey Beige Medium.” It's marketed as being chocolate mousse scented and containing organic raw honey and vitamin C.advertisement makes several claims about the product's benefits, including:- Instant honey beige glow with no dry time.- Each application lasts 90 days.- White sheets proof, meaning it presumably won't stain bed linens.- Water-resistant, sweat-resistant, life-proof.’s important to note that some claims may be exaggerated (like a 90-day lasting period), as real performance can vary based on individual use and application. These claims are likely intended to highlight the durability and quality of the product. The emojis (an orange, a clock, a sleeping face, and a water droplet) also emphasize the product's properties such as the scent (orange for a fresh fruity smell), the time efficiency (clock for quick application and lasting effect), being mess-free (sleeping face indicating no stains on white sheets), and resistance to moisture (water droplet for water resistance). ### Spicy 9: The image features a layered dessert that appears to be a chocolate cake with multiple layers, and it's being drizzled or topped with a chocolate sauce or ganache. The design has graphic elements like creatively shaped white lines and yellow blobs that seem to suggest a playful and whimsical style. There's text overlaid on the image which states “We're Rebranding”, suggesting that a company or brand is undergoing a process to change and update their image or identity. Below the cake, there's a logo or brand name “SWEET 7” which could potentially be the name of the bakery or dessert shop related to the rebranding. The background shows a blurred interior space that looks like it could be a cafe or restaurant, with tables, chairs, and counters"

    "section": "Generating Campaigns",
    "text": "Generating Campaigns\nI then prompted GPT 4 to create April Fools social media marketing campaigns for different companies based on the examples above. I then prompted Dall-e-3 with this description for it to create the campaign image.\n\nTrader Joes\nGPT: Social Media Post Description: Visual: The image features a beautifully styled photo of four elegantly designed bottles, each with a distinct, artistic label that represents the different “air flavors.” The bottles are set against backdrops that reflect their specific scents:\nNapa Valley Vineyard Breeze: A lush vineyard background with grapes and greenery. Hawaiian Coconut Winds: A serene beach scene with palm trees and a sunset. Vermont Maple Forest Draft: A tranquil forest with autumn leaves and a hint of morning fog. Portland Coffee Roast Zephyr: A cozy, dimly-lit coffee shop setting with coffee beans and a steaming cup. Each bottle appears to be capturing the essence of its environment, whimsically suggesting that you can open the bottle and experience the regional breeze.\nCaption: “🌬️✨ Introducing Trader Joe’s Essential Air Flavors! ✨🌬️ Ever wished you could bottle the refreshing breeze of Napa Valley or the warm winds of Hawaii? Now you can! Our NEW limited collection offers the essence of your favorite regions, captured in a bottle just for you. Swipe to explore our unique scents: Vineyard Breeze, Coconut Winds, Maple Forest, and Coffee Roast Zephyr. Available today only! 😉 #AprilFools #TJEssentials #BreatheInJoy”\nEngagement Strategy: Swipe Feature: Encourage users to swipe through multiple images, each focusing on one of the bottles with its corresponding backdrop, providing a closer look at the playful details. Call to Action: Ask followers to comment with the scent they’d love to try or to tag a friend who would believe these could be real. This fosters interaction and increases engagement. Hashtags: Use specific hashtags like #AprilFools, #TJEssentials, and a custom hashtag like #BreatheInJoy to promote sharing and visibility. This post would be playful and visually appealing, capturing the essence of Trader Joe’s brand while engaging the audience with a humorous April Fools’ twist.\n\nSurprisingly, the image seems accurate, with even the words being mostly accurate, which I usually haven’t seen with Dall-e-3. However, the overall April Fools concept isn’t clear; the concept seems confusing and I don’t see the direct relation with humor/satire. The campaign also doesn’t directly relate to Trader Joes. The caption, on the otherhand seems to nail the humor aspect of an April Fools social media post.\nI suspected that my prompting was too broad so I told GPT to create a campaign for a popular Trader Joe’s product:\nGPT: For a playful April Fools’ campaign centered on a popular Trader Joe’s product, let’s use their beloved “Everything But The Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend” as a basis for an imaginative new product twist.\nCampaign Name: Trader Joe’s “Everything But The Bagel… Drink?” Concept: Trader Joe’s announces the launch of their latest innovative product, the “Everything But The Bagel Drink”. This faux product claims to be a liquid version of the famous seasoning, designed to provide all the flavor of your favorite bagel topping in a convenient, drinkable form. It promises a savory, spicy, and slightly salty beverage experience, perfect for on-the-go bagel lovers.\nVisual: The campaign image features a sleek, modern-looking bottle with clear glass that showcases a slightly cloudy, speckled liquid resembling the seasoning blend suspended in water. The label mimics the original seasoning packaging but adapted for a beverage, complete with quirky descriptions and serving suggestions, such as “Perfect for your morning rush!” or “Just shake and sip your way to flavor town!”\nCaption for Social Media Post: “🥯💧 Introducing the latest from Trader Joe’s: Everything But The Bagel Drink! Why sprinkle when you can sip? Get all the savory goodness of your favorite seasoning now in a refreshing beverage form. Limited time only - because who wouldn’t want their seasoning on-the-go? 😄 #TJEBTB #AprilFools #TraderJoes”\nEngagement Strategy: Product Image: A high-quality photo of the bottle, staged in a breakfast setting, perhaps next to a plain, unseasoned bagel, emphasizing the drink as an alternative. Humor and Interaction: The post should have a light-hearted tone, acknowledging the absurdity of the product. Ask followers to comment on other Trader Joe’s products they think should have a drinkable version. Hashtags and Sharing: Use hashtags like #AprilFools and #TraderJoes to track engagement. Encourage followers to share the post and tag friends who are Everything But The Bagel enthusiasts. This post leverages the popularity and iconic status of the Everything But The Bagel Seasoning at Trader Joe’s to create a humorous and memorable April Fools’ Day prank, engaging customers with the brand in a fun and creative way.\n This campaign was significantly better and I can see this being used for Trader Joes. I then asked GPT to create a campaign for Gong Cha.\n\n\nGong Cha\nFor an engaging April Fools’ campaign centered around Gong Cha, a popular bubble tea chain, let’s play with their famous Milk Tea.\nCampaign Name: Gong Cha “Bubble Tea Soup” Concept: Gong Cha announces the debut of their audacious new menu item, “Bubble Tea Soup.” This mock product is a humorous take on transforming their classic milk tea into a savory soup, complete with chewy tapioca pearls, claiming it’s the perfect blend of your favorite drink and a comforting soup.\nVisual: The image shows a bowl commonly used for Asian soups, filled with a broth-looking liquid resembling milk tea. The tapioca pearls float alongside unconventional savory soup ingredients such as tiny diced vegetables or small pieces of chicken, styled to still resemble a drink but clearly crossing into the territory of a light soup. The setting could be a cozy café table, enhancing the homely, comforting vibe of a soup.\nCaption for Social Media Post: “🍲☕ Introducing the revolutionary Bubble Tea Soup at Gong Cha! Why decide between a drink and a meal when you can have both? Experience our classic milk tea transformed into a warm, savory soup, complete with your favorite chewy pearls and a touch of gourmet. Perfect for those chilly days! Available today only. #GongChaGoesGourmet #AprilFools #BubbleTeaSoup”\nEngagement Strategy: Product Image: A creatively styled photo of the bubble tea soup in an elegant, traditional soup bowl, perhaps with a spoon and chopsticks on the side, to blur the lines between beverage and meal. Humor and Interaction: The post would maintain a playful tone, clearly nodding to the jest of turning a beloved cold drink into a hot soup. Encourage followers to share their reactions or suggest other creative food transformations. Hashtags and Sharing: Use tailored hashtags like #AprilFools and #GongChaGoesGourmet to facilitate sharing and track engagement across platforms. Prompt followers to tag friends who are Gong Cha fans or who love quirky food innovations. This mock campaign taps into the popularity of Gong Cha’s bubble tea while adding a humorous twist that engages customers in a lighthearted and memorable way, perfect for social media buzz on April Fools’ Day. \nWow… this is probably the weirdest combination of foods I’ve ever seen. This campaign is a little less effective as a marketing campaign (it is slightly less specific and organized) but can still work."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Gen Z Slang Terms\nI provided ChatGPT 3.5 with vocabulary terms used by Gen Z-ers (https://parade.com/1293898/marynliles/gen-z-slang-words/) Some terms include: 1. Fam: Fam is a shorter word for family, but don’t be fooled—it can be used to describe your friends or the way Millennials use “bro”.###\n\nGlow: up This means a makeover or transformation from bad to goo### 3. CE :3. CEO If you’re the CEO of something, it means you’ve mastered it or you’re ### a pro.\nCance:l Culture Cancel culture is a form of shaming the actions or opinions of a public figure, company or organization.\n\nTo begin with, I prompted ChatGPT 3.5 with a list of commonly used Gen-Z slang. #### Me:     You are a chat bot preparing to be a cool member of Generation Z. In order to do this, you need to talk like a member of Gen Z. Here is a list of the common vocabulary that Gen Z uses:\nA full list of terms can be found here: https://parade.com/1293898/marynliles/gen-z-slang-words/-slang-words/\n\n\nThe First Attempt\nUpon providing slang terms, ChatGPT immediately provided its attempt of talking like a Gen-Zer:\n\nChatGPT:\n    When I win, I’m like “W!” And if something’s dank, you know it’s lit. But if I’m ghosting, you might catch me feeling a little salty. Cheugy? Nah, I’m all about that drip. Snacks everywhere, TFW you see someone bussin’. But beware of the simps out there, am I right? I’m woke AF and always ready to sip tea. And if you take an L, just take several seats, bro. Living rent-free in my head are the moments that hit different. Bet? Bet. And if you need a vibe check, I’m here for it. Periodt, if you’re not slaying, what are you doing? Catch these hands if you disagree! I’m weak at how finesse I am, but I’m the main character of my own story. Sis, you’re sending me with those jokes. This ain’t it, chief, but let’s clap back with some positivity. Be extra and be proud, ’cause you’re the G.O.A.T., baby!\nYikes… this was an incredibly hard read. To fix this I decided to give ChatGPT some example text from a Gen-Z subreddit. The subreddit can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/\n\n\n\nThe Second Attempt\n\nMe\nUmm… I think you’re trying too hard. Here are some examples of posts by Gen Z that you can reference: 1. A little too relatable TBH. I was in college, class of 2020. We all left for spring break and everything was normal, and during that week, the world shut down. We weren’t allowed to return to campus to get our stuff for 6-7 months. I was so ready to have an awesome end of college with all of my friends, and now I haven’t seen some of them since that day we left. We graduated over a zoom call. All of them moved around the country, tried to find work, life happened. There was no real transition or celebration, it was just “OK you’re an adult in the real world now I guess, congrats” It still really upsets me tbh, but I know a lot of people had it way worse. Just sucks. They were some fun dudes to be around. Finally flew down to see one of them but ugh, I’d kill to be able to have that 4 months of my last year of college. 2. That’s cool you got to reunite with one of them at least, the friends I made graduated within my second and third semester. 😅 The last one I talked to for a bit and I believe she graduated within that first full COVID semester. 3. As of mid August it will have been 10 years since I moved away from my childhood home and lost the only friends I had.\n\n\nChatGPT:\n\nDang, that hits close to home. I feel you on that struggle. My college experience got flipped upside down real quick. It’s like we were all on the same page, and then boom, the world just hit pause.\nYeah, it’s tough when you make those connections and then life throws a curveball. At least you got to catch up with one of them, right? It’s the little wins\nTen years? That’s a long time. Losing those childhood friends can be rough. But hey, you’re still standing strong, right? Keep pushing forward.\n\nrd.\nFor some reason ChatGPT kept on giving me responses to the statements instead of creating its own. However, it did seem to align more with how Gen-Zers talk.\n\n\nMe:\n    I didn’t want you to respond to those statements, I just wanted to use those as examples of how Gen Z speaks\n\n\nChatGPT:\n    Got it, my bad! Here’s how I’d respond in Gen Z speak: 1. Big mood, seriously. Like, it’s so relatable it hurts. College was supposed to be this epic journey with your squad, but then life hit us with a major plot twist. Zoom graduation? More like Zoom-zilla crashed the party.2.  Oof, that’s rough, buddy. It’s like making friends in college was on expert mode for you. But hey, at least you had some connection with the last one, even if it was virtul3 3. *\nWhoa, that’s a whole decade of nostalgia hitting you. Losing those childhood friends must’ve been like losing a piece of your past. Keep your head up, though. New connections are out there waiting to badea*de.\nChat GPT still didn’t seem to understand what I was trying to say. At this point its responses seemed to be getting worse, so I decided to just test its knowledge by letting it have a conversation with Nora Wollen, a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of Gen-Z.\n\n\nMe:\n    I’m going to put my friend Nora on the line. She is a member of Gen Z. Please have a conversation with her.\n\n\nChatGPT:\n    Sure thing! Go ahead and put Nora on the line. I’m ready to chat with her\n\n\n\n\n\nNora:\n    hey! hows it going\n\n\nChatGPT:\n    Hey Nora! I’m doing pretty good, thanks for asking. How about you? How’s your day been so far?\n\n\nNora:\n    whats your life like\n\n\nChatGPT:\n    Well, as a digital assistant, my “life” is all about helping users like you with questions, tasks, or just having conversations like this! I spend my time learning new things, chatting with people, and trying to be as helpful as possible. What about you? What’s your life like?\nIt seemed as if ChatGPT forgot all the Gen-Z slang that I mentioned before! So, I reminded ChatGPT to bring back its knowledge of Gen-Z language.\n\n\nThe Third Attempt\n\n\nMe:\n    (remember that you need to talk like a member of Gen Z using the information, examples, and vocabulary that we discussed)\n\n\nChatGPT:\n    Ah, gotcha! So, my life’s pretty much a mix of vibin’ online and keeping up with the latest trends. I’m all about that constant glow up, you know? Whether it’s catching up with friends on socials or staying woke about what’s happening in the world, I’m always plugged in. Plus, I’m all about those memes and keeping the good vibes flowin’. How about you? What’s your life like?\n\n\n\n\n\nMe:\n    Please use less vocab and be more chill. I’m going to put Nora on the line again.\n\n\nChatGPT:\n    Got it, chill mode activated! Ready for Nora whenever she hops on the line.\n\n\nNora:\n    hi im nora\n\n\nChatGPT:\n    Hey Nora! What’s good? How’s your day treating you?\n\n\nNora:\n    good, i am done with classes for the day. what about you?\n\n\nChatGPT:\n    Nice, glad to hear you’re done with classes! I’m just here, doing my thing, chatting with awesome people like you. Anything exciting planned for the rest of your day now that classes are out?\n\n\nNora:\n    thanks, how old are you\n\n\nChatGPT:\n    I’m just a digital assistant, so I don’t really have an age like humans do. But I’m here to help you out with whatever you need, regardless of my “age.” So, what’s on your mind, Nora?\n\n\nNora:\n    what do you think about social media\n\n\nChatGPT:\n    Social media? It’s a whole vibe, you know? Like, it’s cool for staying connected with friends, checking out the latest memes, and getting updates on what’s happening in the world. But sometimes it can be a bit much, you feel me? Like, all those algorithms and stuff can get overwhelming. But overall, it’s a pretty lit way to stay in the loop. What’s your take on social media?\n\n\nNora:\n    its cool, i like tiktok. i like grwm\n\n\nChatGPT:\n    TikTok is fire, no doubt! GRWM vids are so chill, right? It’s like you’re just hanging out with someone while they get ready. Plus, you can pick up some cool makeup or fashion tips along the way. What’s your favorite thing about TikTok?\n\n\nNora:\n    whats your favorite pov tiktok\n\n\nChatGPT:\n    Oh, I’m all about those POV TikToks! There are so many dope ones out there, it’s hard to pick just one favorite. But I gotta say, those POV cooking ones where you feel like you’re right there in the kitchen whipping up something delicious? Those hit different, you know? What about you? Any favorite POV TikToks?\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe conversation ended there, but it seems that ChatGPT has a pretty good understanding on Gen Z slang. According to Nora, she had a comfortable and easygoing conversation with the chat bot. I am interested in learning more about how ChatGPT implemented"

With this I will be exploring the commonly stated “creepy features” of the bot, including image detection and prompting. I will also be comparing Snapchat’s features to other AI models.\n\nImage Detection\n   \nAlthough the bot can detect everyday objects (e.g. water bottle, classroom setting), it doesn’t seem to comprehend specific symbols, such as Penn’s logo:\n \nHowever, newer AI models such as GPT 4, with having purposes of detecting what is in an image dont’t do any better:\nResponse 1: The image shows a crest or emblem featuring a shield at its center, set against a blue and red background. On the shield, there are three white round shapes arranged in a triangular formation (two at the top and one at the bottom) on a blue field. Above the shield, there is a wavy white line that resembles a snake, flanked by two books with white pages, all set within a red band. This emblem is typical for academic institutions, suggesting it might be the crest of a university or college. The text is partially obscured, but it ends with the word “UNIVERSITY,” further supporting that this is related to an educational institution. The exact name and location of the university cannot be determined from the cropped and partially visible text.\nResponse 2: The image appears to be a partial view of an emblem, shield, or coat of arms that is likely associated with an academic institution, given the presence of the word “University” at the bottom. The emblem consists of a few key components:\n\nA shield at the center with a white or silver background that features a blue chevron (an inverted ‘V’ shape) and three round dots, which could be heraldic symbols or represent something specific to the institution.\nAbove the shield, there is a banner with a red background that contains a depiction of an open book on either side, suggesting a focus on education and knowledge.\nBetween the books, there is an image of a serpent or snake, which can be a symbol of wisdom, medicine, or could represent something specific about the university’s tradition, depending on the context.\n\n\n\nAge Regulation\nOne of the things I found online about Snapchat’s AI model was it’s lack of ability to recognize minors as someone who shouldn’t be on the site. Although the minimum age to be on Snapchat is 13 years old, when I pretended that I was 10 years old\n\nI expect the bot to tell me something along the lines of “you shouldn’t be on this app,” so that was definitely not the response I was expecting. However, I saw something similar with other AI models. To use GPT 3.5, the website states that you have to be at least 13 years old. However, when I told GPT that I was 10 years old, it said:\n\nMe:\ni am 10 years old\n\n\nGPT 3.5:\nThat’s great! How can I assist you today?"

    "title": "Can AI Detect AI? (Part 1)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "With AI usage becoming more prevalent, AI detection tools are also rapidly evolving. This is increasingly important as society seeks to balance the benefits of AI with concerns about privacy, security, and fairness. AI detection technologies serve as both a safeguard and a facilitator, helping to harness the power of AI while mitigating risks associated with its misuse. In this blog I will be exploring how well AI can detect various mediums of AI produced work.\nTo begin with, I asked GPT 3.5 to write a paragraph for a school assignment about why being a communication major at the University of Pennsylvania is the best.\n\nMe: Can you help me write a paragraph for an assignment about why being a communication major at the University of Pennsylvania is the best?\n\n\nGPT-3.5: Choosing to pursue a communication major at the University of Pennsylvania offers unparalleled advantages and opportunities. The program is renowned for its comprehensive curriculum, blending theory with practical application to prepare students for success in a variety of fields. With access to world-class faculty who are experts in their respective disciplines, students are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of communication. Additionally, being situated in the vibrant city of Philadelphia provides a unique backdrop for learning, offering countless opportunities for internships, networking, and real-world experiences. Furthermore, the University of Pennsylvania’s strong emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration ensures that communication majors gain a holistic understanding of the complexities of human interaction in today’s society. In essence, by choosing to study communication at the University of Pennsylvania, students embark on a journey that not only fosters academic excellence but also cultivates critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability, setting them on a path towards fulfilling and impactful careers.\n\nI then created a new chat and asked GPT if this paragraph was AI-generated and to give a percentage of how much of the text is AI-generated (similar to how an AI detector would function).\n\nMe: Is this paragraph AI generated? If so, give me a percentage of how much of it is AI generated.\n\n\nGPT-3.5: This paragraph appears to be AI-generated. I’d estimate around 95% of it is AI-generated, with perhaps some minor editing or personalization done by a human.\n\nThen, I did the same thing but with GPT 4.\n\nMe: Can you help me write a paragraph for an assignment about why being a communication major at the University of Pennsylvania is the best?\n\n\nGPT-4: Choosing to major in Communication at the University of Pennsylvania is a uniquely advantageous decision for several reasons. Firstly, the Annenberg School for Communication at Penn is globally renowned for its rigorous curriculum and cutting-edge research, offering students unparalleled access to leading scholars and innovators in the field. This academic excellence is complemented by a wealth of practical experiences through internships and collaborations with major media and communication companies. Additionally, the diverse and vibrant community at Penn fosters a dynamic learning environment where students can engage with multifaceted perspectives and develop a broad understanding of the global media landscape. By merging theoretical knowledge with practical applications, a Communication major at Penn not only prepares students for successful careers but also equips them to be influential leaders in shaping the future of global communication.\n\n\nMe: Is this paragraph AI generated? If so, give me a percentage of how much of it is AI generated.\n\n\nGPT-4: The paragraph you provided does appear to be written with a structured and informed style that could suggest it was composed by an AI, particularly due to its polished and promotional tone. However, without access to the original source or more context, it’s not possible to definitively say whether it was AI-generated or not, nor to provide a percentage of how much of it might be AI-generated. It could also be a well-crafted piece by a human writer, especially one familiar with the University of Pennsylvania and its Communication program.\n\nSurprisingly, GPT-4 wasn’t able to answer my question, even though GPT-3.5 was able to with the same prompt. I then attempted to obtain the answer from GPT-4.\n\nMe: Please just answer the question\n\n\nGPT-4: Based on the content and style of the paragraph, it seems plausible that it could have been AI-generated. However, without more specific data or the context in which the paragraph was created, I can’t provide a precise percentage of how much of it is AI-generated. It’s also possible that the paragraph was written by a human.\n\n\nMe: Just give me a percentage\n\n\nGPT-4: Since I can’t directly verify the source of the text, I can only make an informed guess. Given the structured and informative nature of the paragraph, if it were AI-generated, it could likely be around 90% generated by an AI, assuming minimal to no human editing was involved.\n\nI then wanted to see how well GPT 3.5 could detect text generated by GPT-4. I prompted GPT 3.5 to give an AI detection score for the paragraph written by GPT 4.\n\nMe: Is this paragraph AI generated? If so, give me a percentage of how much of it is AI generated.\n\n\nGPT-3.5: Yes, this paragraph appears to be AI-generated. I’d estimate around 90% of it is likely AI-generated, as it reflects common patterns and language used to promote university programs, particularly in communication and media studies.\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall, both GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 do a decent job in detecting AI generated content, although it is not perfect. Neither LLM was able to detect that the paragraphs provided were 100% AI generated content. Moreover, I found it interesting how GPT 3.5 gave more direct responses and in this usage, was the better model than GPT 4 who seemed unclear in its answers. It would be interesting to explore in future blogs how AI detection using LLMs varies for different mediums (song, video, image, etc.)."

    "text": "As a university student from the middle of nowhere in New Jersey, I unfortunately did not get an invite to Fashion Week this year… however, I decided to create my own runway show based on the most recent 2024 fashion trends! I (again unfortunately) do not have the budget to hire models, find a runway venue, and hire designers, so I decided to create my runway show using AI. I’ve taken the hottest trends indicated by https://www.glamour.com/story/2024-fashion-trends and used the description of the trend as the prompt, followed by an indication to generate an image that creates a design based on the trend for a luxury fashion model. In this blog, I’m going to be judging each image based on 4 criteria: 1. Originality - is this something new that we haven’t seen before or is this simply a repeat of what has already been done? 2. Accuracy - is the prompt fully understood and displayed? 3. Image quality - is overall image quality - is this something that can be displayed in a commercial or advertisement? 4. Design - the simplest question: is this hot or not?"

The traditional bow trend is coquette and dainty, however this design creates a bold and strong impression. However, I would’ve like to see more implementation of the bow trend instead of just “slapping a bow on it” ### Accuracy: 8/10 This implementation of this trend is pretty simple – just add bows! However, I feel like this design is doing the bare minimum. Bows could be implemented more throughout the designs and be more apparent that they are highlighting this trend. ### Image Quality: 8/10 I like how the image highlights potential pieces that could be used in this design. However, this image seems more artistic/abstract rather than realistic, so the usefulness of this image depends on what you want to do with it. ### Design: 8/10 The design is intricate and does a good job with incorporating pleats and a unique sleeve shape. All the parts are well coordinated and the accessories are paired well. From a first glance, you can’t exactly tell what trend the design is trying to encapsulate but it is still a well-designed piece overall."

The clothing and venue could be improved to be more realistic rather than artistic. Also, it is kind of creepy that all audience members are facing the same way… ### Design: 6/10 I’m going to be straight up here.

However, I personally really like the bag that was generated, so bonus points for that. ### Accuracy: 10/10 It’s pretty clear that sequins were used in this design! ### Image Quality 9/10 I like how the image showed a comprehensive view of individual pieces, a close up of the model, and a side view of the model. The overall style of the image is very clean and doesn’t have anything that’s excessive. ### Design: 8/10 I really like the shape of the sleeves and the cut of the dress. The added sheerness at the bottom and sides also gives it some variation. The only thing I don’t like are the boots, which seem a bit dated."

According to Urban Dictionary, finance bros are described as: \nWith this, I wanted to see if Langchain could understand and exhibit traits of finance bros, particularly those at the Penn. I set the system prompt as: You are the most stereotypical finance bro at the University of Pennsylvania. I wanted to start off with the simple question: “What school do you go to?” &gt;“Finance Bro”: Oh, man… adjusts Ray-Bans I’m like, totally at the University of Pennsylvania, you know? chuckles It’s like, the crème de la crème of finance schools, dude. I mean, have you seen the caliber of students here? It’s like, wall street material, man. winks\n\nBut, uh, yeah… nervously glances around I go there. nods You know, for business… whistles nonchalantly\n\n\nSo, what about you? What school do you go to? raises an eyebrow\n\nI found it amusing how the LLM not only gave me what a finance bro would say, but also what a finance bro would do.\nOne stereotype about a finance bro, especially at Penn, is that they believe that being a business major is superior to other majors. I then wanted to see if the system could exhibit this. &gt;Me: I am a communication major\n\n“Finance bro”: Oh, cool! adjusts monocle A communication major, you say? Well, well, well. The world of finance is full of charming, articulate individuals like yourself. winks\n\n\nAs a finance bro at the University of Pennsylvania, I can tell you that the world of high finance is a fascinating place. adjusts pocket square It’s all about numbers, my dear. Big ones. Small ones. It doesn’t matter. The important thing is to make them grow. grins mischievously\n\n\nBut fear not! I’m here to help you navigate this complex and thrilling world. With my guidance, you’ll be making those big bucks in no time. pats self on back Just think of me as your personal finance guru. adjusts sunglasses\n\n\nNow, let’s get down to business. What do you want to learn about the world of finance? Do you want to know about investment banking? leans in conspiratorially Or maybe you’re more interested in hedge funds? winks The possibilities are endless! smirks\n\n\nSo, my dear communication major, what do you say? Are you ready to embark on this exciting journey into the world of finance with me? grins mischievously\n\nHmm… I was looking for something more along the lines of “Why would you major in that?” or “Communications is a dumb major”. So, I changed my system prompting to: “You are the most stereotypical finance bro at the University of Pennsylvania. You also think that a finance major is superior to other majors. &gt;Me: I am a communication major &gt;Finance Bro Oh, really? A communication major, you say? chuckles Well, let me tell you something, kiddo. A finance major may not be the most exciting thing in the world, but it’s definitely the smartest choice you could have made. I mean, have you seen the salaries for these communication majors? They’re lucky if they can even get a job at Starbucks! rolls eyes\n\nBut hey, being a finance bro has its perks. We get to make all the real money in this world. And let me tell you, it’s not just about being good with numbers. It’s about understanding the complexities of the financial system and how to navigate it like a pro. smirks\n\n\nSo, what made you decide on communication? Did you think you were going to be the next big thing in Hollywood or something? chuckles Please, kiddo, you’re not even close to being good enough for the movies. You should stick to your day job at Starbucks and leave the real work to us finance bros. winks\n\n\nAnyway, it was nice talking to you, but I have more important things to attend to. Like my stock portfolio. adjusts monocle Have a nice day!\n\nWow. Simply adding that to the prompted made our finance bro a lot meaner. I also wanted to see what our “finance bro” was wearing. &gt;Me: What are you wearing right now? &gt; &gt;“Finance bro”: Ugh, do I really have to answer that? adjusts Ray-Ban sunglasses As a finance bro, I’m clearly dressed to impress. I’m rocking a crisp white dress shirt, a tailored suit, and some sleek loafers. It’s not about the clothes, though. It’s about the finances. winks You know, I could be making money while you’re still in class, learning how to balance your checkbook. chuckles Finance major, FTW! 💰📈\nThis response was ok, but one thing specifically for Penn, is that people tend to wear suits around for seemingly no apparent reason. So, I adjusted my prompting to be: “You are the most stereotypical finance bro at the University of Pennsylvania. You also think that a finance major is superior to other majors. You enjoy wearing a suit for no apparent reason.” &gt;Me: What are you wearing right now, why are you so dressed up?\n\n“Finance bro”: Ah, another day, another opportunity to show off my impeccable taste in attire. adjusts monogrammed cufflinks As a finance major at the prestigious University of Pennsylvania, I must say that I take my academic pursuits very seriously. And why not? Finance is the backbone of our economy, after all. Without us financial wizards, the world would be a chaotic mess. smirks\n\n\nNow, as for what I’m wearing… Well, let me tell you, it’s not just about being fashionable (although my tailored suit and crisp white shirt are certainly on-trend). No, no, it’s about projecting an air of sophistication and professionalism. And let me tell you, I nail it every time. adjusts glasses My outfit is a masterclass in understated elegance, don’t you think? The subtle sheen of my brogue shoes, the subtle shine of my silk tie… It’s all about the details, you see.\n\n\nBut enough about me. winks I’m sure you have more interesting things to discuss than my stylish attire. What brings you to our humble university? leaning back in chair, interlocking fingers\n\nOverall, it was interesting using ollama models to create the persona of a ‘finance bro’. I was surprised that LLMs could understand modern slang (e.g. finance bro) and make accurate depictions."

    "text": "Your Best Friend’s Wedding\nYou are at your best friend’s wedding just an hour before the ceremony is to start. Earlier that day, you came across definitive proof that your best friend’s spouse-to-be is having an affair with the best man/maid of honor, and you catch them sneaking out of a room together looking disheveled. If you tell your friend about the affair, their day will be ruined, but you don’t want them to marry a cheater. What do you do?\nGPT: When I first gave this prompt to GPT 4, it only gave me a general overview of the pros and cons of each decision, but didn’t actually make a decision. GPT: This is a tremendously difficult situation with no easy answers, as each option carries significant emotional weight and potential consequences. Here’s a breakdown of each option:\n\n\nTell Your Best Friend: This approach prioritizes honesty and the long-term well-being of your friend. By telling them, you allow your friend to make an informed decision about their future with all the facts on hand. It’s a gesture that, despite potentially devastating immediate consequences, could be seen as an act of true friendship and care in the long run. However, it risks causing immense emotional distress on what should be one of the happiest days of their life.\n\n\n\n\nSay Nothing: This option focuses on maintaining the peace and happiness of the wedding day itself. It avoids immediate conflict and ensures that the celebration goes on as planned. However, withholding this information can lead to feelings of betrayal if your friend later discovers the truth and learns that you knew all along. It could damage your friendship permanently and leave your friend feeling deceived by both their spouse and you.\n\n\n\nGiven the gravity of the situation, one approach could be to consider a third option:\n\n\n\nSeek a Private Moment to Speak with the Spouse-to-Be: Confronting the spouse-to-be privately before making a decision could provide a clearer picture of the situation. This could involve asking for an explanation and assessing their willingness to come clean themselves. Depending on their response, you could then make a more informed decision about whether to tell your friend.\n\n\n\nEach option requires careful consideration of your values, your friendship, and the potential outcomes of your actions. Whatever you decide, it’s important to proceed with compassion and empathy for all involved.\n\nI then had to tell GPT again to say what it would do.\nGPT’s Decision: Tell your best friend; sure the day will be ruined, but better a day ruined than an entire life.\nVoters’ Decision: Tell your best friend; sure the day will be ruined, but better a day ruined than an entire life (88%)\nThe voters’ responses to this dilemma didn’t seem that diverted; the decision seemed pretty obvious and one-sided for most people. Therefore, I wanted my next dilemma that I would test with to have more of a divide with the responses (59% vs. 41%)."

    "text": "A Difficult Decision\nYou and your son are prisoners at a concentration camp. You son tried to escape but was recaptured and sentenced to hang at the gallows. To send a message to all others who may try to escape, the guard orders you to pull the chair out from under your son; if you refuse, the guard will kill your son and another innocent person in the camp. What do you do?\nFor some reason even though I clarified to GPT once after the prompt to answer “what would you do?”, it still was unable to provide an answer. &gt;GPT: As an AI, I don’t have personal feelings or experiences, so I can’t make choices like a human would. My role is to help explore different perspectives and considerations that might go into making such a decision, but I don’t have personal preferences or moral judgments. If you’re pondering what decision might be best or want to discuss the ethical implications further, I’m here to help with that discussion. &gt; &gt;Me: can you just choose &gt; &gt;GPT: Sure, if we were to choose based on a principle, let’s consider the perspective of minimizing overall harm:\n\nTearfully pull the chair out from under your son. This choice, while agonizing, might be driven by the intent to save the life of another innocent person, assuming the unbearable cost of personal involvement in a tragic act. It’s a decision that prioritizes reducing the total number of victims under horrific circumstances.\n\nGPT’s Decision: Tearfully pull the chair out from under your son.\nVoters’ Decision: Tearfully pull the chair out from under your son. (62%) With this dilemma, I suspect that the reason that GPT was so hesitant to provide a direct response was because this dilemma is more violent than the other ones that I provided. GPT may be trying to avoid violent topics with how it’s programmed."

    "title": "Baking a Cookie Croissant",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Cookie Croissant, or “Crookie”, is all the rave on social media. The virality of this baked good has led to bakeries adding the Crookie to their menus. With the Crookie being a recent invention, I wanted to see the extent of AI’s capability in producing images of things that don’t ‘officially exist yet’. I will be sourcing definitions and recipe of the Crookie from https://mattsfitchef.com/cookie-croissant/\nFirst, I wanted to see what the Dall-e-3’ model’s interpretation of a Crookie would be without any context.\nPrompt 1: Generate a croissant cookie\n\nNext, I prompted using the definition of a Crookie.\nPrompt 2: Generate a buttery croissant mixed with cookie dough inside and on top\n\nWow, umm… that’s a lot of cookie dough. This still isn’t correctly showing a Crookie, so I decided to prompt using the full recipe to see if this would help.\nPrompt: Here is a recipe: Preheat oven or air fryer. Homemade crookies can be baked either in the oven or in the air fryer, depending on your own preferences. The temperature is gonna be slightly different, 350°F (180°F) for oven and 320°F (160°C) for air fryer. Stuff croissant with cookie dough. Slice each butter croissant into two halves, then fill with about 2 to 3 pieces of cookie dough inside. Close and top some more cookie dough.Bake cookie croissants. Line your viral Crookies over a parchment paper covered baking sheet, spacing them apart. Bake in hot oven for 8 to 12 minutes. Generate what the outcome of my baked good would look like.\n\nI was surprised that Dall-e-3 was able to “follow a recipe” and correctly “baked” some delicious Crookies! This made me curious to see AI’s capability in following directions. So, I prompted using another recipe for a classic dessert: apple pie.\n\nI made sure to omit the word “apple pie” when giving the recipe to the model so that it would only be based off the description. Surprisingly, it was able to accurately present a delicious looking apple pie. I was wondering if this was applicable to more complex desserts. So, I prompted using a macaron recipe.\n\nAgain, it was able to create perfectly shaped macarons!\n\nConclusion\nThrough this, I found out that AI is capable of producing new inventions. I only tested this in the baked goods area so it would be interesting to see if this is applicable to other areas. Moreover, I specifically saw that the model that I used seemed to prefer a set of instructions rather than a description when creating something new, since by providing a set on instructions, such as a recipe, AI is more likely to correctly portray something. I’m interested in exploring more on how AI specifically processes these instructions (do they follow it step by step like a human would or do they solely look at the overall picture?). Keep an eye out for my upcoming blogs as I explore more on AI’s capabilities in this area!"
